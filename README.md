## How to Add Your Own Students, Teachers, and Pictures  

- Upload all pictures to the `image/pictures` folder.  
- Upload student pictures to the `image/student` folder.  
- Upload teacher pictures to the `image/teacher` folder.  

Next, navigate to the `json` folder. Inside, you'll find two files: `peopleData.json` and `pictureData.json`.  
These files allow you to add students, teachers, and pictures. I have included some examples to show you how the system works.  

Once you've made your changes, click **"Commit changes."** GitHub will take a few minutes to process, and your website will be updated with your new pictures.

## How to Update Your Page

2. Click the **"Sync fork"** button.  
3. Then, click **"Update branch"**  
4. GitHub will take a few minutes to process, and your site will be up to date.
