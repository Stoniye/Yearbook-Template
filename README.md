## How customize the Website  

- Upload all pictures to the `image/pictures` folder. (supported: .png, .jpeg, .jpg)
- Upload student pictures to the `image/student` folder. (supported: .png, .jpeg, .jpg)
- Upload teacher pictures to the `image/teacher` folder. (supported: .png, .jpeg, .jpg, .mp4)

Next, navigate to the `json` folder. Inside, you'll find two files: `peopleData.json` and `pictureData.json`. 
These files allow you to add students, teachers, and pictures. I have included some examples to show you how the system works.

You can also edit the `languageData.json` to customize the language

Once you've made your changes, click **"Commit changes."** GitHub will take a few minutes to process, and your website will be updated with your new pictures.

## How to Update Your Page  

GitHub does not automatically update your page when I make changes to the template. To update your page:  

1. Navigate to your repository.  
2. Click the **"Sync fork"** button.  
3. Then, click **"Update branch"**  
4. GitHub will take a few minutes to process, and your site will be up to date.
